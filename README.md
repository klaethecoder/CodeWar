# CodeWar Practive

This repo is to help me to remember the different practice problems that I go through but also
to shed light for other new developers like myself wanting to learn more. I will be mainly focusing
on Python and JavaScript but as I delve deeper into this programming journey I might be adding more 
languages of focus. Happy Coding all :)
