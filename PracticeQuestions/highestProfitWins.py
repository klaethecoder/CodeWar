# Instructions
# Story
# Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't 
# give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it 
# for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

# Task
# Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

# Examples
# min_max([1,2,3,4,5])   == [1,5]
# min_max([2334454,5])   == [5, 2334454]
# min_max([1])           == [1, 1]
# Remarks
# All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your 
# function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.
